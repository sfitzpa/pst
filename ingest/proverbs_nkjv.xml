		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel: </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> To know wisdom and instruction, To perceive the words of understanding, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> To receive the instruction of wisdom, Justice, judgment, and equity; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion -- </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> A wise [man] will hear and increase learning, And a man of understanding will attain wise counsel, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> To understand a proverb and an enigma, The words of the wise and their riddles. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of knowledge, [But] fools despise wisdom and instruction. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> My son, hear the instruction of your father, And do not forsake the law of your mother; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> For they [will be] a graceful ornament on your head, And chains about your neck. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> If they say, "Come with us, Let us lie in wait to [shed] blood; Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, And whole, like those who go down to the Pit; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> We shall find all [kinds] of precious possessions, We shall fill our houses with spoil; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Cast in your lot among us, Let us all have one purse" -- </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> My son, do not walk in the way with them, Keep your foot from their path; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Surely, in vain the net is spread In the sight of any bird; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> But they lie in wait for their [own] blood, They lurk secretly for their [own] lives. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> So [are] the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain; It takes away the life of its owners. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Wisdom calls aloud outside; She raises her voice in the open squares. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> She cries out in the chief concourses, At the openings of the gates in the city She speaks her words: </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? For scorners delight in their scorning, And fools hate knowledge. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Turn at my rebuke; Surely I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Because I have called and you refused, I have stretched out my hand and no one regarded, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Because you disdained all my counsel, And would have none of my rebuke, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your terror comes, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> When your terror comes like a storm, And your destruction comes like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of the LORD, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> They would have none of my counsel [And] despised my every rebuke. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, And be filled to the full with their own fancies. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> For the turning away of the simple will slay them, And the complacency of fools will destroy them; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> But whoever listens to me will dwell safely, And will be secure, without fear of evil." </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> My son, if you receive my words, And treasure my commands within you, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> So that you incline your ear to wisdom, [And] apply your heart to understanding; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Yes, if you cry out for discernment, [And] lift up your voice for understanding, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> If you seek her as silver, And search for her as [for] hidden treasures; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, And find the knowledge of God. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth [come] knowledge and understanding; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; [He is] a shield to those who walk uprightly; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> He guards the paths of justice, And preserves the way of His saints. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then you will understand righteousness and justice, Equity [and] every good path. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> When wisdom enters your heart, And knowledge is pleasant to your soul, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Discretion will preserve you; Understanding will keep you, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> To deliver you from the way of evil, From the man who speaks perverse things, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> From those who leave the paths of uprightness To walk in the ways of darkness; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Who rejoice in doing evil, [And] delight in the perversity of the wicked; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Whose ways [are] crooked, And [who are] devious in their paths; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> To deliver you from the immoral woman, From the seductress [who] flatters with her words, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Who forsakes the companion of her youth, And forgets the covenant of her God. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> For her house leads down to death, And her paths to the dead; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> None who go to her return, Nor do they regain the paths of life -- </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> So you may walk in the way of goodness, And keep [to] the paths of righteousness. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> For the upright will dwell in the land, And the blameless will remain in it; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But the wicked will be cut off from the earth, And the unfaithful will be uprooted from it. </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> My son, do not forget my law, But let your heart keep my commands; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> For length of days and long life And peace they will add to you. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Let not mercy and truth forsake you; Bind them around your neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> [And] so find favor and high esteem In the sight of God and man. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and depart from evil. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> It will be health to your flesh, And strength to your bones. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Honor the LORD with your possessions, And with the firstfruits of all your increase; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> So your barns will be filled with plenty, And your vats will overflow with new wine. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> My son, do not despise the chastening of the LORD, Nor detest His correction; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> For whom the LORD loves He corrects, Just as a father the son [in whom] he delights. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Happy [is] the man [who] finds wisdom, And the man [who] gains understanding; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> For her proceeds [are] better than the profits of silver, And her gain than fine gold. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> She [is] more precious than rubies, And all the things you may desire cannot compare with her. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Length of days [is] in her right hand, In her left hand riches and honor. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, And all her paths [are] peace. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> She [is] a tree of life to those who take hold of her, And happy [are all] who retain her. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding He established the heavens; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> By His knowledge the depths were broken up, And clouds drop down the dew. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> My son, let them not depart from your eyes -- Keep sound wisdom and discretion; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> So they will be life to your soul And grace to your neck. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then you will walk safely in your way, And your foot will not stumble. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> When you lie down, you will not be afraid; Yes, you will lie down and your sleep will be sweet. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Do not be afraid of sudden terror, Nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> For the LORD will be your confidence, And will keep your foot from being caught. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, When it is in the power of your hand to do [so.] </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come back, And tomorrow I will give [it,"] When [you have] it with you. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Do not devise evil against your neighbor, For he dwells by you for safety's sake. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Do not strive with a man without cause, If he has done you no harm. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Do not envy the oppressor, And choose none of his ways; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> For the perverse [person is] an abomination to the LORD, But His secret counsel [is] with the upright. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> The curse of the LORD [is] on the house of the wicked, But He blesses the home of the just. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Surely He scorns the scornful, But gives grace to the humble. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The wise shall inherit glory, But shame shall be the legacy of fools. </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Hear, [my] children, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> For I give you good doctrine: Do not forsake my law. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> When I was my father's son, Tender and the only one in the sight of my mother, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> He also taught me, and said to me: "Let your heart retain my words; Keep my commands, and live. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Get wisdom! Get understanding! Do not forget, nor turn away from the words of my mouth. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you; Love her, and she will keep you. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Wisdom [is] the principal thing; [Therefore] get wisdom. And in all your getting, get understanding. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Exalt her, and she will promote you; She will bring you honor, when you embrace her. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> She will place on your head an ornament of grace; A crown of glory she will deliver to you." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And the years of your life will be many. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in right paths. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When you walk, your steps will not be hindered, And when you run, you will not stumble. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Take firm hold of instruction, do not let go; Keep her, for she [is] your life. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Do not enter the path of the wicked, And do not walk in the way of evil. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Avoid it, do not travel on it; Turn away from it and pass on. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> For they do not sleep unless they have done evil; And their sleep is taken away unless they make [someone] fall. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> But the path of the just [is] like the shining sun, That shines ever brighter unto the perfect day. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> The way of the wicked [is] like darkness; They do not know what makes them stumble. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Do not let them depart from your eyes; Keep them in the midst of your heart; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> For they [are] life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it [spring] the issues of life. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Put away from you a deceitful mouth, And put perverse lips far from you. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Let your eyes look straight ahead, And your eyelids look right before you. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Ponder the path of your feet, And let all your ways be established. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Do not turn to the right or the left; Remove your foot from evil. </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> My son, pay attention to my wisdom; Lend your ear to my understanding, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> That you may preserve discretion, And your lips may keep knowledge. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey, And her mouth [is] smoother than oil; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Her feet go down to death, Her steps lay hold of hell. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Lest you ponder [her] path of life -- Her ways are unstable; You do not know [them.] </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Therefore hear me now, [my] children, And do not depart from the words of my mouth. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Remove your way far from her, And do not go near the door of her house, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Lest you give your honor to others, And your years to the cruel [one;] </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Lest aliens be filled with your wealth, And your labors [go] to the house of a foreigner; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And you mourn at last, When your flesh and your body are consumed, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And say: "How I have hated instruction, And my heart despised correction! </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me! </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> I was on the verge of total ruin, In the midst of the assembly and congregation." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Drink water from your own cistern, And running water from your own well. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Should your fountains be dispersed abroad, Streams of water in the streets? </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Let them be only your own, And not for strangers with you. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Let your fountain be blessed, And rejoice with the wife of your youth. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> [As a] loving deer and a graceful doe, Let her breasts satisfy you at all times; And always be enraptured with her love. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> For why should you, my son, be enraptured by an immoral woman, And be embraced in the arms of a seductress? </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> For the ways of man [are] before the eyes of the LORD, And He ponders all his paths. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> His own iniquities entrap the wicked [man,] And he is caught in the cords of his sin. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> He shall die for lack of instruction, And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> My son, if you become surety for your friend, [If] you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> You are snared by the words of your mouth; You are taken by the words of your mouth. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So do this, my son, and deliver yourself; For you have come into the hand of your friend: Go and humble yourself; Plead with your friend. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Give no sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand [of the hunter,] And like a bird from the hand of the fowler. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and be wise, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Which, having no captain, Overseer or ruler, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Provides her supplies in the summer, [And] gathers her food in the harvest. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> How long will you slumber, O sluggard? When will you rise from your sleep? </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep -- </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> So shall your poverty come on you like a prowler, And your need like an armed man. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> A worthless person, a wicked man, Walks with a perverse mouth; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> He winks with his eyes, He shuffles his feet, He points with his fingers; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Perversity [is] in his heart, He devises evil continually, He sows discord. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly; Suddenly he shall be broken without remedy. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> These six [things] the LORD hates, Yes, seven [are] an abomination to Him: </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> A proud look, A lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> A false witness [who] speaks lies, And one who sows discord among brethren. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> My son, keep your father's command, And do not forsake the law of your mother. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Bind them continually upon your heart; Tie them around your neck. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When you roam, they will lead you; When you sleep, they will keep you; And [when] you awake, they will speak with you. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> For the commandment [is] a lamp, And the law a light; Reproofs of instruction [are] the way of life, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> To keep you from the evil woman, From the flattering tongue of a seductress. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Do not lust after her beauty in your heart, Nor let her allure you with her eyelids. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> For by means of a harlot [A man is reduced] to a crust of bread; And an adulteress will prey upon his precious life. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Can a man take fire to his bosom, And his clothes not be burned? </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Can one walk on hot coals, And his feet not be seared? </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> So [is] he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; Whoever touches her shall not be innocent. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> [People] do not despise a thief If he steals to satisfy himself when he is starving. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Yet [when] he is found, he must restore sevenfold; He may have to give up all the substance of his house. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding; He [who] does so destroys his own soul. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Wounds and dishonor he will get, And his reproach will not be wiped away. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> For jealousy [is] a husband's fury; Therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> He will accept no recompense, Nor will he be appeased though you give many gifts. </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> My son, keep my words, And treasure my commands within you. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Keep my commands and live, And my law as the apple of your eye. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Say to wisdom, "You [are] my sister," And call understanding [your] nearest kin, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> That they may keep you from the immoral woman, From the seductress [who] flatters with her words. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> For at the window of my house I looked through my lattice, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And saw among the simple, I perceived among the youths, A young man devoid of understanding, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Passing along the street near her corner; And he took the path to her house </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> In the twilight, in the evening, In the black and dark night. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And there a woman met him, [With] the attire of a harlot, and a crafty heart. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> She [was] loud and rebellious, Her feet would not stay at home. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> At times [she was] outside, at times in the open square, Lurking at every corner. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> So she caught him and kissed him; With an impudent face she said to him: </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "[I have] peace offerings with me; Today I have paid my vows. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> So I came out to meet you, Diligently to seek your face, And I have found you. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> I have spread my bed with tapestry, Colored coverings of Egyptian linen. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Come, let us take our fill of love until morning; Let us delight ourselves with love. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> For my husband [is] not at home; He has gone on a long journey; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> He has taken a bag of money with him, [And] will come home on the appointed day." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> With her enticing speech she caused him to yield, With her flattering lips she seduced him. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Immediately he went after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, Or as a fool to the correction of the stocks, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Till an arrow struck his liver. As a bird hastens to the snare, He did not know it [would cost] his life. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Now therefore, listen to me, [my] children; Pay attention to the words of my mouth: </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not stray into her paths; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> For she has cast down many wounded, And all who were slain by her were strong [men.] </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Her house [is] the way to hell, Descending to the chambers of death. </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Does not wisdom cry out, And understanding lift up her voice? </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> She takes her stand on the top of the high hill, Beside the way, where the paths meet. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> She cries out by the gates, at the entry of the city, At the entrance of the doors: </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "To you, O men, I call, And my voice [is] to the sons of men. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> O you simple ones, understand prudence, And you fools, be of an understanding heart. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Listen, for I will speak of excellent things, And from the opening of my lips [will come] right things; </VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8"> All the words of my mouth [are] with righteousness; Nothing crooked or perverse [is] in them. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> They [are] all plain to him who understands, And right to those who find knowledge. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold; </VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12"> " I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, And find out knowledge [and] discretion. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> The fear of the LORD [is] to hate evil; Pride and arrogance and the evil way And the perverse mouth I hate. </VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21"> That I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth, That I may fill their treasuries. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> " The LORD possessed me at the beginning of His way, Before His works of old. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> I have been established from everlasting, From the beginning, before there was ever an earth. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> When [there were] no depths I was brought forth, When [there were] no fountains abounding with water. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills, I was brought forth; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> While as yet He had not made the earth or the fields, Or the primeval dust of the world. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> When He prepared the heavens, I [was] there, When He drew a circle on the face of the deep, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> When He established the clouds above, When He strengthened the fountains of the deep, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> When He assigned to the sea its limit, So that the waters would not transgress His command, When He marked out the foundations of the earth, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Then I was beside Him [as] a master craftsman; And I was daily [His] delight, Rejoicing always before Him, </VERS>
