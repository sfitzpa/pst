<thought id='1'>I think someone should have had the decency to tell me the luncheon was free. To make someone run out with potato salad in his hand, pretending he's throwing up, is not what I call hospitality. </thought>
<thought id='2'>I wish a robo would get elected president. That way, when he came to town, we could all take a shot at him and not feel too bad. </thought>
<thought id='3'>When I was a kid, my favourite relative was Uncle Caveman. After school we'd all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he would eat one of us. It wasn't until later that I found out that Uncle Caveman was a bear. </thought>
<thought id='4'>I bet the main reason the police keep people away from a plane crash is they don't want anybody walking in and lying down in the crash stuff, then, when somebody comes up, act like they just woke up and go, "What was THAT?!" </thought>
<thought id='5'>I guess we were all guilty, in a way. We all shot him, we all skinned him, and we all got a complimentary bumper sticker that said, "I helped skin Bob." </thought>
<thought id='6'>If you define cowardice as running away at the first sign of danger, screaming and tripping and begging for mercy, then yes, Mr. Brave Man, I guess I'm a coward. </thought>
<thought id='7'>Sometimes I think the world has gone completely mad. And then I think, "Aw, who cares?" And then I think, "Hey, what's for supper?" </thought>
<thought id='8'>If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and your friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be to pretend you were swimming. </thought>
<thought id='9'>If you were a poor Indian with no weapons, and a bunch of conquistadors came up to you and asked where the gold was, I don't think it would be a good idea to say, "I swallowed it. So sue me." </thought>
<thought id='10'>I bet for an Indian shooting an old fat pioneer woman in the back with an arrow, and she fires her shotgun in the ground as she falls over, is like the top thing you can do. </thought>
<thought id='11'>What is it that makes a complete stranger dive into an icy river to save a solid gold baby? Maybe we'll never know. </thought>
<thought id='12'>If you ever go temporarily insane, don't shoot somebody, like a lot of people do. Instead, try to get some weeding done, because you'd really be surprised. </thought>
<thought id='13'>As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint gray, I thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how gray he was, and how I named him Flint. </thought>
<thought id='14'>I think people tend to forget that trees are living creatures. They're sort of like dogs. Huge, quiet, motionless dogs, with bark instead of fur. </thought>
<thought id='15'>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind." Basically, it's made up of two separate words-"mank" and "ind." What do these words mean? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind. </thought>
<thought id='16'>He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land. He loved it so much he made a woman out of dirt and married her. But when he kissed her, she disintegrated. Later, at the funeral, when the preacher said, "Dust to dust," some people laughed, and the cowboy shot them. At his hanging, he told the others, "I'll be waiting for you in heaven -- with a gun." </thought>
<thought id='17'>It takes a big man to cry, but it takes an even bigger man to laugh at that man. </thought>
<thought id='18'>If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You see, we build to that. </thought>
<thought id='19'>Probably the earliest flyswatters were nothing more than some sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick. </thought>
<thought id='20'>Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral, which have been painted brown and attached to the skull by common wood screws, can make a child look like a deer. </thought>
<thought id='21'>If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flipper, which one would you think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd be wrong, though. It's Hambone. </thought>
<thought id='22'>If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason. </thought>
<thought id='23'>To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other. </thought>
<thought id='24'>If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him is "God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing to tell him is "Probably because of something you did." </thought>
<thought id='25'>Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what if I was an ant, and she fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny. </thought>
<thought id='26'>I'd rather be rich than stupid. </thought>
<thought id='27'>If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you because, hey, free dummy. </thought>
<thought id='28'>If you're a young Mafia gangster out on your first date, I bet it's real embarrassing if someone tries to kill you. </thought>
<thought id='29'>We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients. But we can't scoff at them personally, to their faces, and this is what annoys me. </thought>
<thought id='30'>Better not take a dog on the space shuttle, because if he sticks his head out when you're coming home his face might burn up. </thought>
<thought id='31'>I'd like to see a nude opera, because when they hit those high notes, I bet you can really see it in those genitals. </thought>
<thought id='32'>32.You know what would make a good story? Something about a clown who makes people happy, but inside he's real sad. Also, he has severe diarrhea. </thought>
<thought id='33'>To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kind of scary. I've wondered where this started, and I think it goes back to the time I went to the circus, and a clown killed my dad. </thought>
<thought id='34'>Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little trick to calm myself down. I'll go over to the person's house and ring the doorbell. When the person comes to the door, I'm gone, but you know what I've left on the porch? A jack-o-lantern with a knife stuck in the side of it's head with a note that says "You." After that I usually feel a lot better, and no harm done. </thought>
<thought id='35'>If you're a horse, and someone gets on you, and falls off, and then gets right back on you, I think you should buck him off right away. </thought>
<thought id='36'>I hope if dogs ever take over the world, and they choose a king, they don't just go by size, because I bet there are some Chihuahuas with some good ideas. </thought>
<thought id='37'>Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto someone's neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I have to laugh, because what is that thing? </thought>
<thought id='38'>As we were driving, we saw a sign that said "Watch for Rocks." Martha said it should read "Watch for Pretty Rocks." I told her she should write in her suggestion to the highway department, but she started saying it was a joke -- just to get out of writing a simple letter! And I thought I was lazy! </thought>
<thought id='39'>As I bit into the nectarine, it had a crisp juiciness about it that was very pleasurable -- until I realized it wasn't a nectarine at all, but A HUMAN HEAD!!! </thought>
<thought id='40'>I bet one legend that keeps recurring throughout history, in every culture, in the story of Popeye. </thought>
<thought id='41'>Laurie got offended because I used the word "puke." But to me, that's what her dinner tasted like. </thought>
<thought id='42'>Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess is why several of us died of tuberculosis. </thought>
<thought id='43'>One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to take my little nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old burned-down warehouse. "Oh, no," I said, "Disneyland burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down, he thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the real Disneyland, but it was getting pretty late. </thought>
<thought id='44'>'The crow was calling his name', thought Caw. </thought>
<thought id='45'>I love to go to the schoolyard and watch the children jump and scream, but they don't know I'm using blanks. </thought>
<thought id='46'>If you work on a lobster boat, sneaking up behind people and pinching them is probably a joke that gets old real fast. </thought>
<thought id='47'>If you go to a party, and you want to be the popular one at the party, do this: Wait until no one is looking, then kick a burning log out of the fireplace onto the carpet. Then jump on top of it with your body and yell, "Log o' fire! Log o' fire!" I've never done this, but I think it'd work. </thought>
<thought id='48'>I think college administrators should encourage students to urinate on walls and bushes, because then when students from another college come sniffing around, they'll know this is someone else's territory. </thought>
<thought id='49'>Marta says the interesting thing about fly-fishing is that it's two lives connected by a thin strand. Come on, Marta. Grow up. </thought>
<thought id='50'>Love can sweep you off your feet and carry you along in a way you've never known before. But the ride always ends, and you end up feeling lonely and bitter. Wait. It's not love I'm describing. I'm thinking of a monorail. </thought>
<thought id='51'>When this girl at the art museum asked me whom I liked better, Monet or Manet, I said, "I like mayonnaise." She just stared at me, so I said it again, louder. Then she left. I guess she went to try to find some mayonnaise for me. </thought>
<thought id='52'>It's fascinating to think that all around us there's an invisible world we can't even see. I'm speaking, of course, of the World of the Invisible Scary Skeletons. </thought>
<thought id='53'>Sometimes life seems like a dream, especially when I look down and see that I forgot to put on my pants. </thought>
<thought id='54'>Marta was watching the football game with me when she said, "You know, most of these sports are based on the idea of one group protecting its territory from invasion by another group." "Yeah," I said, trying not to laugh. Girls are funny. </thought>
<thought id='55'>It's amazing to me that one of the world's most feared diseases would be carried by one of the world's smallest animals: the real tiny dog. </thought>
<thought id='56'>I hate it when people say somebody has a "speech impediment", even if he does, because it could hurt his feelings. So instead, I call it a "speech improvement", and I go up to the guy and say, "Hey, Bob, I like your speech improvement." I think this makes him feel better. </thought>
<thought id='57'>I think my new thing will be to try to be a real happy guy. I'll just walk around being real happy until some jerk says something stupid to me. </thought>
<thought id='58'>Of all the imaginary friends I've had, I don't think there was one that I didn't end up having to kill. </thought>
<thought id='59'>Instead of mousetraps, what about baby traps? Not to harm the babies, but just to hold them down until they can be removed? </thought>
<thought id='60'>Sometimes I think I would like to be named The Prince of Weasels. As the Prince of Weasels, I could sneak up behind people and bite them. Then they would turn around and say, "what the...oh, it's just you the Prince of Weasels." </thought>
<thought id='61'>If you ever drop your keys into a river of molten lava, forget em', cause, man, they're gone. </thought>
<thought id='62'>When Gary told me he had found Jesus, I thought, Yahoo! We're rich! But it turned out to be something different. </thought>
<thought id='63'>Probably the saddest thing you'll ever see is a mosquito sucking on a mummy. Forget it, little friend. </thought>
<thought id='64'>If you lived in the Dark Ages, and you were a catapult operator, I bet the most common question people would ask is, "Can't you make it shoot any farther?" No. I'm sorry. That's as far as it shoots. </thought>
<thought id='65'>Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful flamingo, flying across in front of a beautiful sunset? And he's carrying a beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's carrying a very beautiful painting with his feet. And also, you're drunk. </thought>
<thought id='66'>To me, it's a good idea to always carry two sacks of something when you walk around. That way, if anybody says, "Hey, can you give me a hand?" you can say, "Sorry, got these sacks." </thought>
<thought id='67'>The memories of my family outings are still a source of strength to me. I remember we'd all pile into the car - I forget what kind it was - and drive and drive. I'm not sure where we'd go, but I think there were some trees there. The smell of something was strong in the air as we played whatever sport we played. I remember a bigger, older guy we called "Dad." We'd eat some stuff, or not, and then I think we went home. I guess some things never leave you. </thought>
<thought id='68'>Contrary to what most people say, the most dangerous animal in the world is not the lion or the tiger or even the elephant. It's a shark riding on an elephant's back, just trampling and eating everything they see. </thought>
<thought id='69'>We used to laugh at Grandpa when he'd head off and go fishing. But we wouldn't be laughing that evening when he'd come back with some whore he picked up in town. </thought>
<thought id='70'>Children need encouragement. If a kid gets an answer right, tell him it was a lucky guess. That way he develops a good, lucky feeling. </thought>
<thought id='71'>When you die, if you get a choice between going to regular heaven or pie heaven, choose pie heaven. It might be a trick, but if it's not, mmmmmmm, boy. </thought>
<thought id='72'>Whether they find a life there or not, I think Jupiter should be called an enemy planet. </thought>
<thought id='73'>Instead of trying to build newer and bigger weapons of destruction, we should be thinking about getting more use out of the ones we already have. </thought>
<thought id='74'>I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate revolver. and since he is so busy, you'd probably have to run up to him real quick and give it to him. </thought>
<thought id='75'>Just because swans mate for life, I don't think its that big a deal. First of all, if you're a swan, you're probably not going to find a swan that looks much better than the one you've got, so why not mate for life? </thought>
<thought id='76'>If you're robbing a bank and you're pants fall down, I think it's okay to laugh and to let the hostages laugh too, because, come on, life is funny. </thought>
<thought id='77'>If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid looking in a mirror, because I bet that will really throw you into a panic. </thought>
<thought id='78'>Sometimes I think I'd be better off dead. No, wait, not me, you. </thought>
<thought id='79'>I can't stand cheap people. It makes me real mad when someone says something like, "Hey, when are you going to pay me that $100 you owe me?" or "Do you have that $50 you borrowed?" Man, quit being so cheap! </thought>
<thought id='80'>I think the mistake a lot of us make is thinking the state-appointed shrink is our friend. </thought>
<thought id='81'>I think one way the cops could make money would be to hold a murder weapons sale. Many people could really use used ice picks. </thought>
<thought id='82'>If you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking beer, I bet you could shoot beer out of you nose. </thought>
<thought id='83'>I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not our children's children, because I don't think children should be having sex. </thought>
<thought id='84'>If I ever get real rich, I hope I'm not real mean to poor people, like I am now.</thought>
<thought id='85'>I wish outer space guys would conquer the Earth and make people their pets, because I'd like to have one of those little beds with my name on it. </thought>
<thought id='86'>It's true that every time you hear a bell, an angel gets its wings. But what they don't tell you is that every time you hear a mouse trap snap, an Angel gets set on fire. </thought>
<thought id='87'>If you're in a war, instead of throwing a hand grenade at the enemy, throw one of those small pumpkins. Maybe it'll make everyone think how stupid war is, and while they are thinking, you can throw a real grenade at them. </thought>
<thought id='88'>I hope life isn't a big joke, because I don't get it. </thought>
<thought id='89'>The next time I have meat and mashed potatoes, I think I'll put a very large blob of potatoes on my plate with just a little piece of meat. And if someone asks me why I didn't get more meat, I'll just say, "Oh, you mean this?" and pull out a big piece of meat from inside the blob of potatoes, where I've hidden it. Good magic trick, huh? </thought>
<thought id='90'>If they ever come up with a swashbuckling school, I think one of the courses should be laughing, then jumping off something. </thought>
<thought id='91'>Here's a good thing to do if you go to a party and you don't know anybody:  First take out the garbage.  Then go around and collect any extra garbage  that people might have, like a crumpled napkin, and take that out too.  Pretty soon people will want to meet the busy garbage guy.</thought>
<thought id='92'>When you're riding in a time machine way far into the future, don't stick your elbow out the window, or it'll turn into a fossil. </thought>
<thought id='93'>A good way to threaten somebody is to light a stick of dynamite. Then you call the guy and hold the burning fuse up to the phone. "Hear that?" you say. "That's dynamite, baby." </thought>
<thought id='94'>Why do people in ship mutinies always ask for "better treatment"? I'd ask for a pinball machine, because with all that rocking back and forth you'd probably be able to get a lot of free games. </thought>
<thought id='95'>Sometimes I think you have to march right in and demand your rights, even if you don't know what your rights are, or who the person is you're talking to. Then on the way out, slam the door.</thought>
<thought id='96'>Broken promises don't upset me.  I just think, why did they believe me?</thought>
<thought id='97'>I bet when the Neanderthal kids would make a snowman, someone would always end up saying, "Don't forget the thick, heavy brows." Then they would all get embarrassed because they remembered they had the big hunky brows too, and they'd get mad and eat the snowman. </thought>
<thought id='98'>Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's say you're an astronaut on the moon and you fear that your partner has been turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out for the moon pieces, wham!, you just slam the door behind him and blast off. He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but you just say, "Think again, bat man." </thought>
<thought id='99'>Too bad you can't buy a voodoo globe so that you could make the earth spin real fast and freak everybody out. </thought>
<thought id='100'>If you go to a costume party at your boss's house, wouldn't you think a good costume would be to dress up like the boss's wife?  Trust me, it's not.</thought>
<thought id='101'>I wish I had a Kryptonite cross, because then you could keep both Dracula AND Superman away. </thought>
<thought id='102'>I don't think I'm alone when I say I'd like to see more and more planets fall under the ruthless domination of our solar system. </thought>
<thought id='103'>The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of the face. </thought>
<thought id='104'>Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap. The flytrap can bite and bite, but it won't bother the frog because it only has little tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen and it could be like ambition. </thought>
<thought id='105'>When you go in for a job interview, I think a good thing to ask is if they ever press charges. </thought>
<thought id='106'>As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red again, I sat there thinking about life. Was it nothing more than a bunch of honking and yelling? Sometimes it seemed that way. </thought>
<thought id='107'>During the Middle Ages, probably one of the biggest mistakes was not putting on your armor because you were just going down to the corner. </thought>
<thought id='108'>When I was a child, there were times when we had to entertain ourselves. And usually the best way to do that was to turn on the TV. </thought>
<thought id='109'>I wish I had a dollar for every time I spent a dollar, because then, yahoo!, I'd have all my money back. </thought>
<thought id='110'>The tiger can't change his spots. No wait, he did! Good for him! </thought>
<thought id='111'>If I was a cowboy in a lynch mob, I think I'd try to stay near the back. That way, if somebody shamed us into disbanding, I could sort of slip off to the side and pretend I was window-shopping or something. </thought>
<thought id='112'>If you ever crawl inside an old hollow log and go to sleep, and while you're in there some guys come and seal up both ends and then put it on a truck and take it to another city, boy, I don't know what to tell you. </thought>
<thought id='113'>I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect it. </thought>
<thought id='114'>Instead of having "answers" on a math test, they should just call them "impressions," and if you got a different "impression," so what, can't we all be brothers? </thought>
<thought id='115'>Most of the time it was probably real bad being stuck down in a dungeon. But some days, when there was a bad storm outside, you'd look out your little window and think, "Boy, I'm glad I'm not out in that." </thought>
<thought id='116'>Somebody told me how frightening it was how much topsoil we are losing each year, but I told that story around the campfire and nobody got scared. </thought>
<thought id='117'>If I was being executed by injection, I'd clean up my cell real neat. Then, when they came to get me, I'd say, "Injection? I thought you said inspection." They'd probably feel real bad, and maybe I could get out of it. </thought>
<thought id='118'>If you're a blacksmith, probably the proudest day of your life is when you get your first anvil. How innocent you are, little blacksmith. </thought>
<thought id='119'>I bet a funny thing about driving a car off a cliff is, while you're in midair, you still hit those brakes! Hey, better try the emergency brake! </thought>
<thought id='120'>I remember that one fateful day when Coach took me aside. I knew what was coming. "You don't have to tell me," I said. "I'm off the team, aren't I?" "Well," said Coach, "you never were really ON the team. You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags and towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at practice and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to get it back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times." It was all true what he was saying. And yet, I thought something is brewing inside the head of this Coach. He sees something in me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that's when I felt the handcuffs go on. </thought>
<thought id='121'>If I ever do a book on the Amazon, I hope I am able to bring a certain lightheartedness to the subject, in a way that tell the reader we are going to have fun with this thing. </thought>
<thought id='122'>It's sad that a family can be torn apart by something as simple as a pack of wild dogs. </thought>
<thought id='123'>Instead of putting a quarter under a kid's pillow, how about a pine cone? That way, he learns that 'wishing' isn't going to save our national forests. </thought>
<thought id='124'>It's funny that pirates were always going around searching for treasure, and they never realized that the real treasure was the fond memories they were creating. </thought>
<thought id='125'>I bet when they weren't fighting, Vikings with horn helmets had to stick potatoes on the ends of the horns, so as to avoid eye-pokings to fellow Vikings and lady Vikings. </thought>
<thought id='126'>Do you know what happens when you slice a golf ball in half? Someone gets mad at you. I found this out the hard way. </thought>
<thought id='127'>I remember how my great-uncle Jerry would sit on the porch and whittle all day long. Once he whittled me a toy boat out of a larger toy boat I had. It was almost as good as the first one, except now it had bumpy whittle marks all over it. And no paint, because he had whittled off the paint. </thought>
<thought id='128'>One thing vampire children have to be taught early on is, don't run with a wooden stake. </thought>
<thought id='129'>Consider the daffodil. And while you're doing that, I'll be over here, looking through your stuff. </thought>
<thought id='130'>When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was call the police. But then I got curious about it. I picked it up, and started wondering who this person was, and why he had deer horns. </thought>
<thought id='131'>For mad scientists who keep brains in jars, here's a tip: why not add a slice of lemon to each jar, for freshness? </thought>
<thought id='132'>The tired and thirsty prospector threw himself down at the edge of the watering hole and started to drink. But then he looked around and saw skulls and bones everywhere. ' Uh-oh,' he thought. 'This watering hole is reserved for skeletons.'  </thought>
<thought id='133'>I hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays its eggs in my brain, because later you might think you're having a good idea but it's just eggs hatching. </thought>
<thought id='134'>If you're a cowboy and you're dragging a guy behind your horse, I bet it would really make you mad if you looked back and the guy was reading a magazine. </thought>
<thought id='135'>If your friend is already dead, and being eaten by vultures, I think it's okay to feed some bits of your friend to one of the vultures, to teach him to do some tricks. But only if you're serious about adopting the vulture. </thought>
<thought id='136'>If you go flying back through time and you see somebody else flying forward into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye contact. </thought>
<thought id='137'>It's easy to sit there and say you'd like to have more money. And I guess thats what I like about it. It's easy. Just sitting there, rocking back and forth, wanting that money.  </thought>
<thought id='138'>I don't pretend to have all the answers. I don't pretend to even know what the questions are. Hey, where am I?  </thought>
<thought id='139'>I think that a hat which has a little cannon that fires and then goes back inside the hat is at least a decade away.  </thought>
<thought id='140'>Isn't it funny how we'll look out the window at the moon, and then we notice it's not the moon but a streetlight? Also what's funny is how we do this every night.  </thought>
<thought id='141'>Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy looks out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I guess that's like a regular window.  </thought>
<thought id='142'>One thing about my Aunt Nadie: She was gruff on the outside, but if you ever needed something, like a spanking or a scolding, she'd give it to you.  </thought>
<thought id='143'>Instead of a Seeing Eye dog, what about a gun? It's cheaper than a dog, plus if you walk around shooting all the time people are going to get out of the way. Cars, too!  </thought>
<thought id='144'>After I die, wherever my spirit goes, I'm going to try to get back and visit my skeleton at least once a year, because, "Hey, old buddy, how's it going?" </thought>
<thought id='145'>I think a good way to get into a movie is to show up where they're making the movie, then stick a big cactus plant onto your buttocks and start yowling and running around. Everyone would think it was funny, and the head movie guy would say, "Hey, let's put him in the movie." </thought>
<thought id='146'>I wouldn't be surprised if someday some fisherman caught a big shark and cut it open, and there inside was a whole person. Then they cut the person open, and in him is a little baby shark. And in the baby shark there isn't a person, because it would be too small. But there's a little doll or something, like a Johnny Combat little toy guy - something like that. </thought>
<thought id='147'>I bet it was pretty hard to pick up girls if you had the Black Death.</thought>
<thought id='148'>The land that had nourished him and had borne him fruit now turned against him and called him a fruit. Man, I hate land like that. </thought>
<thought id='149'>Whenever I hear the sparrow chirping, watch the woodpecker chirp, catch a chirping trout, or listen to the sad howl of the chirp rat, I think: Oh boy! I'm going insane again. </thought>
<thought id='150'>If they have moving sidewalks in the future, when you get on them, I think you should have to assume sort of a walking shape so as not to frighten the dogs. </thought>
<thought id='151'>He was the kind of man who was not ashamed to show affection. I guess that's what I hated about him. </thought>
<thought id='152'>If you want to be the most popular person in your class, whenever the professor pauses in his lecture, just let out a big snort and say "How do you figger that!" real loud. Then lean back and sort of smirk. </thought>
<thought id='153'>Too bad Lassie didn't know how to ice skate, because then if she was in Holland on vacation in winter and someone said "Lassie, go skate for help," she could do it. </thought>
<thought id='154'>If you're ever shipwrecked on a tropical island and you don't know how to speak the natives' language, just say "Poppy-oomy." I bet it means something. </thought>
<thought id='155'>I have to laugh when I think of the first cigar, because it was probably just a bunch of rolled-up tobacco leaves. </thought>
<thought id='156'>I bet it's hard to break farmers of the old superstitions like "Tornado got Old Yeller, stay in the cellar." </thought>
<thought id='157'>If Alien was my friend, I'd like to be with him when he went to the dentist. When they started drilling, he'd probably go nuts and start eating everybody. That Alien! </thought>
<thought id='158'>Many people think that history is a dull subject. Dull? Is it "dull" that Jesse James once got bitten on the forehead by an ant, and at first it didn't seem like anything, but then the bite got worse and worse, so he went to a doctor in town, and the secretary told him to wait, so he sat down and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and then finally he got to see the doctor, and the doctor put some salve on it? You call that dull? </thought>
<thought id='159'>Some folks say it was a miracle. St. Francis suddenly appeared and knocked the next pitch clean over the fence. Other folks say it was just a lucky swing. </thought>
<thought id='160'>Of all the tall tales, I think my favorite is the one about Eli Whitney and the interchangeable parts. </thought>
<thought id='161'>If there was a terrible storm outside, but somehow this dog lived through the storm, and he showed up at your door when the storm was finally over, I think a good name for him would be Carl. </thought>
<thought id='162'>If I had a mine shaft, I don't think I would just abandon it. There's got to be a better way. </thought>
<thought id='163'>I guess I kinda lost control, because in the middle of the play I ran up and lit the evil puppet villain on fire. No, I didn't. Just kidding. I just said that to help illustrate one of the human emotions, which is freaking out. Another emotion is greed, as when you kill someone for money, or something like that. Another emotion is generosity, as when you pay someone double what he paid for his stupid puppet. </thought>
<thought id='164'>I think there should be something in science called the "reindeer effect." I don't know what it would be, but I think it'd be good to hear someone say, "Gentlemen, what we have here is a terrifying example of the reindeer effect." </thought>
<thought id='165'>It makes me mad when I go to all the trouble of having Marta cook up about a hundred drumsticks, then the guy at Marineland says, "You can't throw that chicken to the dolphins. They eat fish." Sure they eat fish, if that's all you give them! Man, wise up. </thought>
<thought id='166'>Anybody who has an identity problem had better wise up and get with the program! </thought>
<thought id='167'>Tonight, when we were eating dinner, Marta said something that really knocked me for a loop. She said, "I love carrots." "Good," I said as I gritted my teeth real hard. "Then maybe you and carrots would like to go into the bedroom and have sex!" They didn't, but maybe they will sometime, and I can watch. </thought>
<thought id='168'>Here's a good joke to do during an earthquake: Straddle a big crack in the earth, and if it opens wider, go, "Whoa! Whoa!" and flail your arms around, as if you're going to fall in. </thought>
<thought id='169'>A funny thing to do is, if you're out hiking and your friend gets bitten by a poisonous snake, tell him you're going to go for help, then go about ten feet and pretend that *you* got bit by a snake. Then start an argument with him about who's going to go get help. A lot of guys will start crying. That's why it makes you feel good when you tell them it was just a joke. </thought>
<thought id='170'>Folks still remember the day ole Bob Riley came bouncing down that dirt road in his pickup. Pretty soon, it was bouncing higher and higher. The tires popped, and the shocks broke, but that truck kept bouncing. Some say it bounced clean over the moon, but whoever says that is a damn liar. </thought>
<thought id='171'>In some places it's known as a tornado. In others, a cyclone. And in still others, the Idiot's Merry-go-round. But around here they'll always be known as screw-boys. </thought>
<thought id='172'>I wish I lived back in the old west days, because I'd save up my money for about twenty years so I could buy a solid-gold pick. Then I'd go out West and start digging for gold. When someone came up and asked what I was doing, I'd say, "Looking for gold, ya durn fool." He'd say, "Your pick is gold," and I'd say, "Well, that was easy." Good joke, huh. </thought>
<thought id='173'>I think somebody should come up with a way to breed a very large shrimp. That way, you could ride him, then, after you camped at night, you could eat him. How about it, science? </thought>
<thought id='174'>I think a good product would be "Baby Duck Hat". It's a fake baby duck, which you strap on top of your head. Then you go swimming underwater until you find a mommy duck and her babies, and you join them. Then, all of a sudden, you stand up out of the water and roar like Godzilla. Man, those ducks really take off! Also, Baby Duck Hat is good for parties. </thought>
<thought id='175'>Laugh, clown, laugh. This is what I tell myself whenever I dress up like Bozo. </thought>
<thought id='176'>Any man, in the right situation, is capable of murder. But not any man is capable of being a good camper. So, murder and camping are not as similar as you might think. Here's a good trick: Get a job as a judge at the Olympics. Then, if some guy sets a world record, pretend that you didn't see it and go, "Okay, is everybody ready to start now?" </thought>
<thought id='177'>Too bad when I was a kid there wasn't a guy in our class that everybody called the "Cricket Boy", because I would have liked to stand up in class and tell everybody, "You can make fun of the Cricket Boy if you want to, but to me he's just like everybody else." Then everybody would leave the Cricket Boy alone, and I'd invite him over to spend the night at my house, but after about five minutes of that loud chirping I'd have to kick him out. Maybe later we could get up a petition to get the Cricket Family run out of town. Bye, Cricket Boy. </thought>
<thought id='178'>The whole town laughed at my great-grandfather, just because he worked hard and saved his money. True, working at the hardware store didn't pay much, but he felt it was better than what everybody else did, which was go up to the volcano and collect the gold nuggets it shot out every day. It turned out he was right. After forty years, the volcano petered out. Everybody left town, and the hardware store went broke. Finally he decided to collect gold nuggets too, but there weren't many left by then. Plus, he broke his leg and the doctor's bills were real high. </thought>
<thought id='179'>I hope, when they die, cartoon characters have to answer for their sins. </thought>
<thought id='180'>When the chairman introduced the guest speaker as a former illegal alien, I got up from my chair and yelled, "What's the matter, no jobs on Mars?" When no one laughed, I was real embarrassed. I don't think people should make you feel that way. </thought>
<thought id='181'>I guess more bad things have been done in the name of progress than any other. I myself have been guilty of this. When I was a teen-ager, I stole a car and drove it out into the desert and set it on fire. When the police showed up, I just shrugged and said, "Hey, progress." Boy, did I have a lot to learn. </thought>
<thought id='182'>Sometimes, when I drive across the desert in the middle of the night, with no other cars around, I start imagining: What if there were no civilization out there? No cities, no factories, no people? And then I think: No people or factories? Then who made this car? And this highway? And I get so confused I have to stick my head out the window into the driving rain - unless there's lightning, because I could get struck on the head by a bolt. </thought>
<thought id='183'>The difference between a man and a boy is, a boy wants to grow up to be a fireman, but a man wants to grow up to be a giant monster fireman. </thought>
<thought id='184'>I think the monkeys at the zoo should have to wear sunglasses so they can't hypnotize you. </thought>
<thought id='185'>Instead of studying for finals, what about just going to the Bahamas and catching some rays? Maybe you'll flunk, but you might have flunked anyway; that's my point. </thought>
