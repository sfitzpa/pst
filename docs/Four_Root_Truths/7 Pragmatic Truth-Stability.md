### Part VII: Pragmatic Truth‑Stability – Measuring Coherence Through Time

If knowledge were merely accumulation, civilization would be a library and not a mind.  But civilizations think, forget, and contradict themselves; their theories age like neurons firing in vast historical loops.  To study truth as a living process, the EE introduces a metric called **pragmatic truth‑stability**—a way to measure whether a worldview is converging toward coherence or diverging into paradox.

#### The Contradiction‑Slope

Imagine every statement in a civilization as a vector of claim and evidence.  Each time new data arrive—scientific discovery, moral revelation, artistic insight—the system either absorbs the data smoothly or generates conflict.  The rate of that conflict’s accumulation defines the **contradiction‑slope (ΔC/Δt)**.

* A **negative slope** means contradictions are resolving; coherence is increasing.
* A **positive slope** means contradictions are multiplying; the worldview is losing integrity.
* A **flat slope** means the culture has stopped learning—it maintains equilibrium through repetition rather than integration.

When mapped historically, each Root Truth draws its own curve.  The Judeo‑Christian line trends gently downward; coherence improves as discoveries reinforce an intelligible cosmos.  The Islamic line holds steady, preserving internal order but resisting innovation.  The Secular‑Humanist line falls sharply then spikes upward as relativism fractures the base.  The Eastern‑Dharmic line remains near zero, immune to contradiction by redefining it away.

#### Why “Pragmatic”

The term does not mean “useful” in the shallow sense; it means *operationally testable*.  A worldview is pragmatically stable if, when reality surprises it, the system can incorporate the new fact without rewriting its first principle.  Newtonian mechanics adjusted to Einstein; it did not burn the notion of law.  But when an ideology must suppress evidence to survive, its slope turns decisively upward.

#### Error as the Pulse of Growth

Truth‑stability does not require perfect knowledge.  It values systems that metabolize error.  A culture that can repent and reform has a lower contradiction‑slope than one that punishes heresy.  In mathematics, we call this convergence; in psychology, learning; in theology, grace.  The name differs, the geometry is the same.

#### Measuring the Mind of a Civilization

The EE treats entire eras as datasets.  Each epoch’s language, art, and law become signals of coherence.  When moral vocabulary widens while logical syntax narrows, the slope rises—meaning fragmentation.  When vocabulary and syntax both clarify, the slope falls—meaning truth is condensing.

Under this model, the health of a civilization can be diagnosed like that of a brain.  Delusion is simply a local region of high contradiction left unintegrated with the rest.  Enlightenment is the steady migration of local coherence into global order.

#### The Limit Case

If pragmatic truth‑stability could reach absolute zero, contradiction would vanish and the system would perfectly mirror reality.  In theological terms, this is omniscience; in psychological terms, sanity.  The approach toward zero is the measure of wisdom; the refusal to measure is the onset of madness.

Thus truth‑stability becomes the shared grammar of philosophy, science, and faith: a way to ask not *what* is true, but *how steadily* a truth can bear the weight of the world.
