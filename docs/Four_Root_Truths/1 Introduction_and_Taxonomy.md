### Part I: Introduction & Taxonomy

Civilizations behave like minds.  They hold a primary assumption about reality, and everything they later build—science, law, art, metaphysics—follows the curvature of that first thought.  When we speak of the **Four Root Truths**, we are naming the four enduring ways humanity has answered the primal question: *Where does meaning come from?*

Each Root Truth begins as an **a priori** premise—a statement accepted before experience—and then unfolds into a culture, a psychology, and a theology.  All later ideas are *a posteriori* consequences: deductions, observations, and systems that grow from the original seed.  Each Root can therefore be tested not by its sentiment but by its **coherence through time**: does the world described by its premise become more ordered and intelligible, or does it decay into contradiction?

#### The Four Axes of Meaning

1. **The Judeo‑Christian Root** – Reality is created by a moral Lawgiver who is distinct from His creation.  Knowledge is possible because the Creator and creation share rational structure; goodness is obedience to the moral order embedded in being.

2. **The Islamic Root** – Reality is the will of God expressed as law.  The divine and the political are fused; truth is submission.  Knowledge is jurisprudence—the study of how power and revelation coincide.

3. **The Secular‑Humanist Root** – Reality has no transcendent author.  Man becomes the measure of all things, constructing morality through consensus and reason.  Progress replaces Providence; truth is what advances human control.

4. **The Eastern‑Dharmic Root** – Reality is cyclical and ultimately illusory.  Salvation lies in perceiving the unity behind opposites and detaching from material striving.  Truth is not discovered or built but *remembered* by awakening.

#### Why Four?

These four are not chosen for symmetry but because every historical civilization traces to one of them.  Each is a closed metaphysical circuit—a system that defines its own source of authority, its own model of time, and its own way of resolving contradiction.  When cultures meet, they rarely invent a fifth premise; they blend or collapse into one of these.

#### How PST and EE Interrogate Them

In the **Predictive Semantic Trellis** (PST) model, each Root Truth is a primary branch—a lattice of assumptions that generates trajectories (R2) and curvatures (R3) across domains.  The **Epistemology Engine** (EE) can treat these as competing hypotheses and evaluate them for *pragmatic truth-stability*: the degree to which new data increases or decreases internal contradiction.

To analyze a civilization, the EE watches how its moral, scientific, and artistic statements evolve.  When contradictions trend toward zero, the Root is self-consistent; when they multiply, it decays.  Thus history becomes an experimental record of metaphysics.

#### Preview of the Journey Ahead

Parts II–V will describe each Root Truth in its full moral and epistemic architecture.  Part VI will introduce the two great methods of knowing—*a priori* and *a posteriori*—and show how every Root privileges one over the other.  Part VII will formalize pragmatic truth-stability as a measurable slope of coherence, and Part VIII will link that slope to psychology itself: the definition of sanity in individuals and civilizations alike.

The purpose of the taxonomy is not polemic but clarity.  When one knows the shape of the four Roots, even disagreement becomes intelligible; one can see *why* minds differ, not merely *that* they do.
