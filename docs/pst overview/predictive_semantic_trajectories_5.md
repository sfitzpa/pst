## Section 5: Architecture of a Directional Knowledge Field

The Predictive Semantic Trajectories (PST) architecture extends beyond mathematics into an applied data model—a persistent field of directed semantic relationships. This structure must preserve motion while allowing for efficient lookup, weighting, and evolution. It becomes a hybrid of vector database, graph network, and temporal ledger.

### 5.1 Structural Overview

The architecture can be envisioned as three interlocking layers:

**1. Base Semantic Layer (Embeddings):**  
A traditional vector store that houses embeddings for discrete entities—tables, fields, concepts, or linguistic tokens. These vectors anchor the field and define the spatial fabric through which meaning flows.

**2. Trajectory Layer (Transitions):**  
Each directed edge between embeddings becomes a stored record. A trajectory entry might look like:
```
{  
  source: "TA_USER",  
  target: "TA_PAYROLL",  
  vector: [Δ1, Δ2, Δ3, ...],  
  weight: 0.94,  
  context: { domain: "Payroll", frequency: 128, last_success: "2025-09-14" }  
}
```
This layer is append-only: it accumulates empirical observations from live sessions, building statistical weight around real flows.

**3. Index and Retrieval Layer:**  
A query engine that, given a partial context, retrieves the most probable continuations from the stored field. It can use vector similarity search to find nearby transitions and graph traversal algorithms (e.g., weighted breadth-first search) to predict multi-step outcomes.

### 5.2 Temporal Dynamics

Each trajectory is timestamped and versioned, allowing the field to evolve with organizational behavior. Frequency decay functions can gradually lower weights for unused paths, ensuring relevance without manual pruning. Over time, \(\mathcal{F}\) becomes a living statistical record of how meaning tends to move within a given domain.

### 5.3 Persistence Mechanisms

For implementation, PST can leverage:
- **Vector databases** (e.g., Milvus, FAISS, or PostgreSQL + pgvector) for storing embeddings.
- **Graph databases** (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB) for maintaining directional relationships and weights.
- **ETL synchronization** with existing data pipelines to ingest observed trajectories from logs, queries, or chat transcripts.

Each observation updates the weight matrix incrementally rather than retraining the model. This allows near-real-time learning—*semantic reinforcement without backpropagation.*

### 5.4 Retrieval Example

A user begins creating a new report involving TA_USER and TA_ACCT. The PST engine queries \(\mathcal{F}\):
1. Identify all trajectories emerging from these nodes.
2. Compute aggregate probabilities of converging paths.
3. Suggest the highest-likelihood endpoint—perhaps TA_LUT_NFC_TCODE leading to a furlough report.

This mechanism blends statistical reasoning with transparent provenance. The system doesn’t invent a guess; it recalls a well-traveled road.

The directional knowledge field thus becomes a persistent layer of institutional experience—an evolving cartography of how reasoning has successfully moved through meaning-space.
