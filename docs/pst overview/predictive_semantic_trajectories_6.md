## Section 6: Comparison with Existing Paradigms

To understand what makes Predictive Semantic Trajectories (PST) distinct, we must compare it with adjacent approaches that attempt to capture relationships in vector or graph space. Each of these paradigms addresses some part of the problem—similarity, direction, hierarchy, or temporal flow—but none combines them into a persistent, reusable structure of proven semantic motion.

### 6.1 Relational and Knowledge Graph Embeddings

Models such as **TransE**, **DistMult**, and **RotatE** represent knowledge as triples—(head, relation, tail)—mapping entities into vector space where \(E_{head} + E_{relation} \approx E_{tail}\). These systems explicitly encode directionality but within a static factual framework: *Paris is the capital of France.* They do not learn from the lived sequence of reasoning events; relations are ontological, not experiential.

PST, in contrast, records *observed directional transitions*—how one concept actually tends to lead to another during reasoning or task execution. It transforms experience into a navigable graph of prior motion, effectively a **temporalized knowledge graph.**

### 6.2 Hyperbolic Embeddings

Hyperbolic spaces (e.g., Poincaré embeddings) are adept at modeling hierarchies, as their geometry naturally allocates more representational capacity near the boundary. This structure captures parent–child or general–specific relationships efficiently. Yet hyperbolic embeddings lack a temporal or causal axis; they encode tree-like containment, not sequential flow.

PST could coexist with hyperbolic geometry by using it as a spatial substrate while adding a directional overlay. The result would be a *causal hierarchy*—an ordered structure in which movement through the hierarchy corresponds to meaningful progression.

### 6.3 Neural Flow and Dynamical Models

Recent work in **neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** and **flow-based embeddings** treats meaning as a continuous transformation through latent space. These models integrate direction and smooth change but do so transiently: each flow exists only during a single forward pass of computation. Once the inference concludes, the flow field disappears.

PST preserves those flows as durable artifacts. Instead of solving a new ODE each time, it stores the empirically observed flow vectors as static records—an engineering inversion that replaces transient computation with cumulative memory.

### 6.4 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG architectures store external documents and retrieve them to ground LLM outputs. While this introduces persistence, it still operates at the level of *content retrieval*, not *semantic trajectory retrieval.* PST would augment or replace RAG’s document-centric memory with a flow-centric one, letting the system recall how reasoning unfolded, not just what text was relevant.

### 6.5 Summary

Most prior paradigms treat relationships as momentary or categorical. PST alone aims to make them **persistent, empirical, and directional.** It captures how meaning travels, not merely how it’s connected. In doing so, it becomes both a memory system and a reasoning substrate—a foundation for models that learn not just facts, but motion through understanding.
