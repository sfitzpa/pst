## Section 7: Prototype Blueprint

A theoretical framework gains power only when it meets reality. The first prototype of Predictive Semantic Trajectories (PST) should prove that directional embeddings can be stored, retrieved, and used to anticipate reasoning outcomes with measurable accuracy. The goal is not to build a massive model, but to test persistence, explainability, and prediction.

### 7.1 Objectives

1. **Capture Empirical Trajectories:**  
   Record real sequences of related entities (tables, queries, or conversation turns) from user sessions.
2. **Store Trajectories as Vector Edges:**  
   Represent each transition as a directed vector embedding enriched with metadata.
3. **Query the Field Predictively:**  
   Given a partial sequence, retrieve likely continuations and compare against ground truth.
4. **Measure Performance:**  
   Evaluate improvements in inference efficiency, accuracy, and explainability relative to a baseline LLM.

### 7.2 Minimal Data Flow

**Step 1: Data Extraction**  
Collect logs from a controlled domain—e.g., analysts building reports in GovTA. Each log entry contains entities accessed, sequence order, and final success outcome. Example:
```
Session 10291 → [TA_USER → TA_ACCT → TA_LUT_NFC_TCODE → TA_FURLOUGH_REPORT]
```

**Step 2: Embedding Generation**  
Use a pretrained model (OpenAI text-embedding-3-large or equivalent) to generate base embeddings for all entities. Compute directional vectors for each transition:
\[ v_{i} = E(entity_{i+1}) - E(entity_{i}) \]

**Step 3: Trajectory Storage**  
Persist each transition in a hybrid vector + graph database:
- Nodes: base embeddings of entities.  
- Edges: directional vectors with metadata (frequency, timestamp, domain).  
- Weight updates: increment by 1 for each observed recurrence.

**Step 4: Predictive Querying**  
When a new session begins, feed partial sequences into the PST engine:
1. Identify the current node(s).
2. Query for high-weight trajectories extending outward.
3. Return the most probable next entities or full trajectories.

**Step 5: Evaluation**  
Compare predicted continuations to actual session outcomes. Metrics:
- **Top-k Accuracy:** proportion of sessions where the true next entity appears in top predictions.  
- **Computation Savings:** reduction in repeated inference steps.  
- **Explainability Rate:** proportion of predictions with traceable historical precedent.

### 7.3 Prototype Stack

| Component | Tool | Purpose |
|------------|------|----------|
| Embedding Model | `text-embedding-3-large` | Generate high-fidelity vectors |
| Graph Store | Neo4j | Maintain directed trajectories |
| Vector Index | FAISS or pgvector | Perform similarity search |
| ETL / Pipeline | Python + FastAPI | Process session logs and updates |
| Visualization | D3.js or Plotly | Render trajectory fields and node heatmaps |

### 7.4 Experiment Goals

1. Demonstrate that stored trajectories can predict future reasoning steps with >80% accuracy in a controlled dataset.
2. Measure reduction in inference recomputation when trajectory retrieval replaces token-level reanalysis.
3. Validate that explanations (path provenance) correlate with user trust and correctness.

If successful, this prototype establishes PST as a persistent reasoning layer—a bridge between ephemeral LLM inference and stable institutional knowledge. It turns language models from momentary thinkers into learners with memory.
