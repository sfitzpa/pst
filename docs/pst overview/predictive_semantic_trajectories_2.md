## Section 2: The Problem — Disposable Inference and Ephemeral Context

Every generation of AI engineers has inherited the same quiet flaw: we train our machines to forget. The most complex inferences ever computed—gigabytes of rich relationships between ideas—dissolve the moment an interaction ends. What persists is a thin residue: token statistics, model weights, and static embeddings. The living geometry of thought never survives the session.

### Disposable Inference

An LLM performs feats of reasoning by dynamically tracing paths through its embedding space. During inference, it builds temporary bridges: how concept A leads to B, under what context, and with what probability. But once a response is delivered, those bridges vanish. Each new prompt triggers a fresh traversal through the latent space, independent of prior journeys.

This approach is computationally elegant but philosophically wasteful. The model spends massive resources rediscovering truths it already knew five seconds ago. Imagine an engineer calculating the same circuit diagram thousands of times because she isn’t allowed to save her blueprints.

### Ephemeral Context

The transformer architecture was designed to encode *attention*, not *memory*. Attention weights model relevance between tokens within a bounded window, but they don’t persist across sessions. Even with retrieval-augmented systems, what’s stored are static documents or vectors—not the actual *reasoning flows* that gave rise to useful outcomes.

When context is ephemeral, every act of reasoning is isolated. The model may remember the *result* of training (“cats are mammals”) but not the *process* that derived it (“we arrived at this through observation, comparison, and taxonomy”). Without stored trajectories, explainability is shallow—akin to a savant who answers perfectly but cannot say why.

### The Cost of Forgetting

This design choice ripples through every layer of AI practice. It fuels hallucination because the model’s sense of cause and effect resets each time. It inflates compute costs because familiar paths must be rediscovered. And it prevents long-term specialization—an LLM can be fine-tuned, but it can’t truly *learn* from its conversations. The vector space holds meaning, but the motion through that space—the path of reasoning—is lost.

Predictive Semantic Trajectories (PST) begin precisely here, proposing that those transient inferences be captured, stored, and indexed. The goal isn’t just persistence but directionality: to create a map of how meaning flows, not just where it resides.
